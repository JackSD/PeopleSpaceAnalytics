# Product Problem Statement 

Studying how humans interact with the built environment is important in improving urban public and private spaces. Architects take interest in how humans interact with their environment and each other in order to optimize and justify design changes. 
The most common solution to this data gathering exercise is to deploy a semi-skilled workforce (often students) who record on a clipboard how people are moving through space. This approach is littered with bias; either through the  recorder, who for example might be tired, might only show up at particular times, or the study is expensive and therefore only runs for a short period or finally, the recorded people may not act normally when being observed by someone with a clipboard. 
The specific questions architects seek to answer about spaces concern how human traffic flows, how many people use the space, when people use the space, what are the peaks, and what people do in the space.

# Solution Description

The solution proposed in this project to this expensive and biased process is to deploy a lightweight edge-based AI device. It requires mobility of the device so it can be placed anywhere, to be able to understand human movement in plan and section, and to protect the privacy of those involved.

This repo is a Flask based web application (screenshot below) whcih interprets the data collected through the edge based device.
